    <div class="wave">
    <p>
      Unit 1 covered basic computer science concepts like binary numbers, digital data, and programming fundamentals. We
      learned how computers use binary numbers to store and process information, and the difference between lossy and
      lossless data compression. Intellectual property rights were also introduced, emphasizing the importance of
      respecting creators' work. Through practical activities, we gained a clear understanding of these core concepts,
      laying a strong foundation for further learning in computer science.</p>

        <li>
          <strong>Lesson 2:</strong> Recall when you built your information sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?
          <p><strong>Answer:</strong> it would become more complicated and more confusing to not easily understand</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lesson 3:</strong> How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?
          <p><strong>Answer:</strong> by showing them the amount of fingers or certain object</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lesson 4d:</strong> What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?
